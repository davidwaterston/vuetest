        <h2>Vue.js examples</h2>
        <p>
            A small collection of simple experiments created when learning <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a>.
            </br>
            Minimal effort made to make them look good and not in any way to be considered good examples of how things should be done!
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong><a href="simplecard.html">A simple repeating layout built using parent/child components</a></strong>
                </br>
                First attempt at creating parent/child components. Data props passed down through each level. No events.
                </br>
                4 components used: simple-title, simple-image, simple-description and a wrapper component simple-card.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong><a href="ajaxlist.html">Retrieve json-formatted data via Ajax, display and filter/move</a></strong>
                </br>
                Retrieves data via Ajax and displays it in a table format. Data can be filtered / re-ordered / added / deleted.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong><a href="itemgen.html">Generate a list of items and allow it to be copied to the clipboard</a></strong>
                </br>
                Work-in-progress for a larger project. This templates displays a list of 'items' (presently just random numbers, as the content is not important for getting this functionality to work). More items can be added and existing ones removed from the list or the list completely refreshed. The list may also be copied to the clipboard.</br>
                One peculiarity: if e.g. 5 items are in the list and the 'Generate 10 Items' button is pressed then 5 new items are added i.e. the original 5 still remain. Similarly, clicking 'Generate 1 Item' would remove all but the original 1st item.
            </li>
        </ul>
